# Odia-Fasttype-windows
Keyboard Transliteration tool for Windows - for typing Odia exceptionally fast


This code is a  background process implementation for smooth typing interface.
One doesn't need to type only on a window to get odia character.
Any window supporting unicode encoding will display Odia characters upon typing.

The basic building block is complete.
But it's not perfect yet.
